iColorProject - Color Personal Project Management 

iColorProject is a personal project manager app that color everything you need to know. Not randomly color everything but color the projects and task properly that you will know what the most important is and only focus on it. 

Base on the methodology of a book "HOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE"  by Alan Lakein, once you add new project, iColorProject will sort all projects and their tasks that you add with the following order: 

A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3 
Class A: the most important tasks, do them first 
Class B: less important tasks, do them when you have time 
Class C: not necessary to do it unless it turn to Class B or A
